A brief about my project is mentioned below:

# Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Banks
Customers form an integral component of any business organization and thus customer satisfaction has been  a top priority for such organizations in order to expand their business.
In the world of business, it is said that every  customer that is lost leads to a loss of capital The aim of this project is to look at the current trends/scenario of a particular bank with respect to its customers. Customer churn is one of the biggest concerns of a bank and through a combination of exploratory data analysis and model predictions the bank intends to retain its customers and minimize customer loss.
Churn is defined as a movement of a customer/client from one company to the other. There are several reasons that may lead to an increase in customer churn in the case of banks. Some of the reasons are stated below: 
a) Availability of latest technology   b)Customer friendly staff c) Low interest rates
On average, service providers such as banks experience a churn rate between 10 to 30 % 
After running prections using machine learning models, the bank wants to know those potential customers who are at risk of leaving the bank so that the bank can direct their efforts towards retaining them through promotions, offers et cetera.


#CUSTOMER CHURN MODELS
Such models are developed to identify those customers who are likely to churn. These models uses historical data on former churners in order to find similarities with existing clients. Customers who are found to exhibit such similarities are classified as potential churners.
Banks choose to focus more on retaining customers because the cost of attracting new customers is much more than the cost incurred on retaining them. Customers who are associated with the bank on a long-term basis less costly to serve and therefore generate higher profit for the bank. Such customers also provide new referrals which negates the needs for banks to direct a chunk of their resources towards attracting new customers.

In this project, the following sequence of actions will be undertaken:
a) An exploratory data analysis of the database will be undertaken to summarize the data and interpretations will be stated as per requirement for better understanding.
b) For predicting possible customer attrition/churn in the future, different models will be used to find the most accurate results which will be used to help the bank to reduce customer churn.
